    FIU's Knight Foundation School of Computing & Information Sciences is one of the top schools for computing, and it is a highly inclusive and welcoming place for students of all abilities. Yet, a mere 24% of students at the school are those who identify as women. We need HELP to figure out how we can tell our school's story better! Here's our challenge: build a project involving AI to help make the school and major more appealing and welcoming to students who identify as women!
